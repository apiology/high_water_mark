Maintains a directory of high water mark metrics for the quality
tools - used by [quality gem](https://github.com/apiology/quality) and friends

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'high_water_mark'
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
gem install high_water_mark
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install
dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run
`bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
install`. To release a new version, update the version number in
`version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will
create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push
the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributions

This project, as with all others, rests on the shoulders of a broad
ecosystem supported by many volunteers doing thankless work, along
with specific contributors.

In particular I'd like to call out:

* [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy) for the
  cookiecutter tool and associated examples, which keep my many
  projects building with shared boilerplate with a minimum of fuss.

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
